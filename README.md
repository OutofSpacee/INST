#Word Counter
  
  #What it can do

    #Counts the number of times a word shows up in a document or documents
    #The word searched for can be made case sensitive or not
    #Can only look up one word at a time
    #Prints the results to the console and saves them to a file

  #Instructions

    #Make sure you have Python installed
    #Make sure mod.py is installed on the same directory as word_count_04.py
    #Run the word_counter.py file
    #Follow the on-screen prompts to input the directory path, word to search for, and case sensitivity preference.

Example

    #Suppose you have a directory named monty_python containing several text files. You want to count the occurrences of the word "the" in all files, regardless of case sensitivity.

    Directory Path: /x/y/monty_python
    Word to Search For: the
    Case Sensitivity: no
    The program will search for "python" in all text files within the texts directory, display the results, and save them to a file named word_count_results.txt.
